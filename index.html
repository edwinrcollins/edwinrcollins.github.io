                            <p>During my time here at SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University), I have found that I know more than I had realized. With each course I took, I found that I would achieve all the goals set for that course. Also, during this time, we lost my mother-in-law, and last year, I had a heart attack and then surgery after that. Despite it all, I still managed to complete all my classes. I am good at object-oriented programming in C++ and Java. I have a wide range of other languages, tools, and skills that can be found in the <a href=#skills>Skills<a/> section. My professional experience covering over 36 years has allowed me to hone my skills in communicating with stakeholders, which enables me to validate and verify requirements and provide updates on current projects. The selected project included in my portfolio will prove these proficiencies. </p>
                            <p>The <a href=#artifact1>first project</a> shows my skills in software design and engineering by implementing and expanding it to a full-stack program that is easy to follow and use. The <a href=#artifact2>second project</a> created a formula for calculating BMI (Body Mass Index), proving my proficiency in data structures. Both projects were done in Android Studio. The <a href=#artifact3>third project<a/> showcases my abilities across all the above categories by designing the databases that are used for tracking all the information for the Android application. It contains various classes, methods, and resource files that are used to create an interface for three SQLite databases with full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality. </p>
                            <p>The project enhancements were done in this last course (November 2024). A video code review of the project can be found from the <a href=#codeReview>Code Review</a> option in the menu. This code review goes through each artifact, analyzing the structure, documentation, variables, arithmetic operations, loops and branches, and enhanced programming for areas of improvement. It also outlines several future enhancements that can be implemented. The pre-enhancement code repository is also located in the <a href=#codeReview>Code Review</a> section. Finally, the post-enhancement version of the project can be found in the <a href=#projects>Projects</a> section. Detailed proficiencies can be found in the accompanying narrative for each artifact.

                            <p><b>Computer Science Capstone Enhancement Narrative</b></p>
                            <p>For my first enhancement I worked on the CS 330 Computation Graphics and Visualization final project. This project was started in October of 2021 and was one of the first complex programs that I had to work on. This program utilizes several other sources of code created by others and successfully puts them together to achieve the intended result. By doing this with consistency, an easy-to-follow structure, and comments that will allow any coder to understand the program’s logic, I have demonstrated abilities in Software Engineering and Design. Specifically, the structure of the program allows for future objects to be easily added with the intention of adding detail to the scene. I demonstrated this through my original code and it’s enhancements, which include: two new hedges, the Sun revolving around the origin, a re-worked center road object, a skybox, refined comments, redundant code removal, style consistency refined, and security modifications.</p>
                            <p>Adding these objects required a few different strategies. For the hedges I used the existing outer hedge object. This object was scaled and then translated to the position it is in now, and this enhancement was done with only 5 lines of code (efficiency). To create the motion of the sun, I added an angular velocity to the object’s position allowing it to rotate around the origin. Then I added keyboard functionality to pause the motion. The “L” key will start the motion and the “K” key will stop the motion. While adding these enhancements to the project, the mismatched textures of the center brick road were too obvious. So, I created a new object with its own texture coordinates to avoid reusing the same road object. Lastly, the blank backdrop was apparent, so I added a simple skybox. </p>
                            <p>Like I mentioned earlier, this was my first complex program. Naturally, there was over-top commenting and redundant code. For example, when adding additional objects before, there was a lot of resetting variables that were already set, or repeated variables due to re-used objects. I cleaned this up and added comments to make it easier to follow. There was also some style (spaces, indents, newlines, etc.) that needed to be straightened out for consistency. And finally, I added in default else statements and caught a couple of memory leaks for added security and efficiency.</p>
                            <p>Honestly, coming into this enhancement I was a little nervous. I could not remember much about the code, and it was a challenge for me during the course. However, after these enhancements, I realized that it was not that hard, and it all came back very quickly. So, the main thing that I learned from returning to this project was confidence in my own abilities. </p>

                            <p>The artifact for my second enhancement is from the CS 405 Module 4 assignment. It’s purpose was to demonstrate unit testing by providing a few examples and then having us create some of our own unit tests using the GoogleTest API. This assignment is from June, 2022.</p>
                            <p>This assignment demonstrates my ability to use complex data structures, such as vectors and smart pointers. It also demonstrates utilization of the GoogleTest API. A big reason why I chose this artifact specifically is that a lot of job descriptions seem to have unit testing as a qualification. Including this artifact proves that I am a capable of incorporating unit testing. Finally, this artifact demonstrates my ability in algorithms by implementing a binary search tree in one of my enhancements. I build a collection using vectors and pointers, then sort, then BST for a specific value.</p>
                            <p>The enhancements done for this project were very straightforward. I added in 3 unit tests using the GoogleTest API. These tests were to verify a specific addition to the collection, verify removal of a range of elements within the collection, and prove functionality of a binary search tree.</p>

                            <p><b>Computer Science Capstone Enhancement Narrative</b></p>
                            <p>This artifact is from the CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming final project. For this project we were given three options to design and create an Android application. I chose to create an app that allows the user to utilize CRUD operations in a daily weight tracker that would also display the delta from a user defined goal weight. This project was originally created in January of 2022.</p>
                            <p>This assignment has a complex, object-oriented structure that utilizes several classes, methods, and resource files all created by me. The application runs intuitively and is designed with a security first mindset to ensure that there are no database vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it demonstrates my ability to utilize SQL databases by creating CRUD operations for two separate SQLite databases. These databases hold sensitive user information that is only accessible to appropriate user. This artifact was improved by adding CRUD operations for an additional column in the weight.db database to track the category of workout the user has conducted on a given day.</p>
                            <p>The enhancements done this week were very straightforward. I added CRUD operations for a fifth column in the weight database. This column is visible within the WeightDataActivity screen, so it required formatting the recycler view and adding in additional variables. For the input validation I used a spinner, which was a new concept for me. It was relatively straight-forward to implement and provides input validation to avoid SQL injection. </p>
