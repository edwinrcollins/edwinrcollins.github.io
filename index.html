                            <p>During my time here at SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University), I have found that I know more than I had realized. With each course I took, I found that I would achieve all the goals set for that course. Also, during this time, we lost my mother-in-law, and last year, I had a heart attack and then surgery after that. Despite it all, I still managed to complete all my classes. I am good at object-oriented programming in C++ and Java. I have a wide range of other languages, tools, and skills that can be found in the <a href=#skills>Skills<a/> section. My professional experience covering over 36 years has allowed me to hone my skills in communicating with stakeholders, which enables me to validate and verify requirements and provide updates on current projects. The selected project included in my portfolio will prove these proficiencies. </p>
                            <p>The <a href=#artifact1>first project</a> shows my skills in software design and engineering by implementing and expanding it to a full-stack program that is easy to follow and use. The <a href=#artifact2>second project</a> created a formula for calculating BMI (Body Mass Index), proving my proficiency in data structures. Both projects were done in Android Studio. The <a href=#artifact3>third project<a/> showcases my abilities across all the above categories by designing the databases that are used for tracking all the information for the Android application. It contains various classes, methods, and resource files that are used to create an interface for three SQLite databases with full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality. </p>
                            <p>The project enhancements were done in this last course (November 2024). A video code review of the project can be found from the <a href=#codeReview>Code Review</a> option in the menu. This code review goes through each artifact, analyzing the structure, documentation, variables, arithmetic operations, loops and branches, and enhanced programming for areas of improvement. It also outlines several future enhancements that can be implemented. The pre-enhancement code repository is also located in the <a href=#codeReview>Code Review</a> section. Finally, the post-enhancement version of the project can be found in the <a href=#projects>Projects</a> section. Detailed proficiencies can be found in the accompanying narrative for each artifact.

                            <p><b>Computer Science Capstone Enhancement Narrative</b></p>
                            <p>My chosen artifact is from my CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming final project. We had three options, and I selected the Weight Tracker. From that course, I only achieved basic coding. I completed only the minimum steps that showed I could use a database and successfully run the application in the Android Studio emulator. The original project was created in April of 2024.</p>
                            <p>I felt this was the perfect artifact for all the milestones. This software design and engineering portion would allow me to build the code to complete the application. The enhancements will show that I can work to complete the design to make it a full-stack application instead of just the login and signup that was previously completed. Improvements included adding the code needed to add the weights you want to track and allowing you to edit and delete the weights. </p>
                            <p>I did find that I needed to redesign the application slightly in order to make the changes I wanted. But overall, I have met the main objectives. I do have some ideas for enhancements in the future</p>
                            <p>Working on the design changes and adding enhancements requires a lot of time and effort. Of all the courses I have taken, I have enjoyed working with the Android studio the most. It is easy to work with, and a wealth of material is available for learning how to use it and building upon previous work.</p>

                            <p>My chosen artifact is from my CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming final project. We had three options, and I selected the Weight Tracker. From that course, I only achieved basic coding. I completed only the minimum steps that showed I could use a database and successfully run the application in the Android Studio emulator. The original project was created in April of 2024.</p>
                            <p>This was the perfect artifact for all the milestones. For the ‘Algorithms and Data Structure’ portion, this would show I can add in the formula for calculating BMI “Body Mass Index” and allow me to show that, as part of the complete design, it will use a database to store user information and BMI data. The enhancements will show that I understand how to add algorithms and data structure to the application. For the improvements for this section, I needed to update the main screen to include a button to go to the BMI calculator. </p>
                            <p>I added it to a database containing the data from the entered BMI calculations. This consists of data, weight, height, and BMI percentage. Future enhancements will allow for sorting the data. I will also need to work on integrating the BMI data with the user signed-in—multiple entries for a given date instead of being limited to a single entry.</p>
							<p>Since I was using a single artifact, it took longer, as I also had to consider the other artifact sections. For my capstone, this does show that the requirements have been met. But going beyond that, I look to keep working on the application. I plan to make it available initially for my family if they want it for their devices and eventually make an application in the Google Play store. </p>

                            <p><b>Computer Science Capstone Enhancement Narrative</b></p>
                            <p>This artifact is from the CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming final project. For this project we were given three options to design and create an Android application. I chose to create an app that allows the user to utilize CRUD operations in a daily weight tracker that would also display the delta from a user defined goal weight. This project was originally created in January of 2022.</p>
                            <p>This assignment has a complex, object-oriented structure that utilizes several classes, methods, and resource files all created by me. The application runs intuitively and is designed with a security first mindset to ensure that there are no database vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it demonstrates my ability to utilize SQL databases by creating CRUD operations for two separate SQLite databases. These databases hold sensitive user information that is only accessible to appropriate user. This artifact was improved by adding CRUD operations for an additional column in the weight.db database to track the category of workout the user has conducted on a given day.</p>
                            <p>The enhancements done this week were very straightforward. I added CRUD operations for a fifth column in the weight database. This column is visible within the WeightDataActivity screen, so it required formatting the recycler view and adding in additional variables. For the input validation I used a spinner, which was a new concept for me. It was relatively straight-forward to implement and provides input validation to avoid SQL injection. </p>
